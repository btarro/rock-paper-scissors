## Summary
This game was written using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries). My intention was for this project to keep the same simple aesthetic as my previous projects, but I did add a bit of CSS image filtering for a dab of color. 

In the future I'd like to shift this project to take advantage of HTML canvas with a touch of animation.
